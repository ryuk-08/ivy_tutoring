                        <h2>About the founder</h2>
                        <p> I have always had a passion to educate young minds and help them blossom
                            into well-rounded, responsible and successful individuals. Throughout 
                            my 29 years of teaching, I have had wonderful opportunities to teach
                            diverse groups of students, including those with learning differences,
                            those who performed at grade level and those who were gifted. As a 
                            result, I have become proficient at designing creative and stimulating
                            lesson plans, which accommodate multiple intelligences, bring a hands-on
                            approach to learning and keep students interested and focused. 
                        </p>
                        <p> My greatesst desire is to inspire and motive students.<br>I actively engage
                            each student by incorporating a variety of manipulatives, enjoyable
                            activities and cooperative leraning projects. I tailor lesson plans to 
                            meet their diverse interests, as well as demostrate direct connections
                            between the classroom and everyday life. The lessons I provide students
                            support strong literacy skills and I try to ensure each student become a
                            proficient reader, writer, speaker, and a lifelong learner.</p>
                        <p>Having been an Educatin Major at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill NY,
                            I am a certified elementary education teacher in NJ and NY. I hold a M.A.
                            in Educational Leadership and Supervision from St. Peter's University and

                            Fairleigh Dickinson University. I am constantly looking for new approaches
                            to reach all students and develop each one into a strong reader.</p>
